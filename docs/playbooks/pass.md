# `pass` Playbooks

I haven't used `pass` much yet, so I haven't figured out how to use it fully. The following resources will be useful in helping develop more automated solutions using it going forward:

* [Online man page](https://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/about/)
* [Using pass in a team](https://medium.com/@davidpiegza/using-pass-in-a-team-1aa7adf36592)
* [Authenticating to AWS with Environment Variables](https://blog.gruntwork.io/authenticating-to-aws-with-environment-variables-e793d6f6d02e)
* [Arch Wiki on pass](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pass)
* [Stack Overflow on pass + gpg](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/53912/i-try-to-add-passwords-to-the-pass-password-manager-but-my-attempts-fail-with)

TODO:
- [ ] GPG setup instructions
- [ ] shared pass setup instructions
- [ ] shared pass integration
